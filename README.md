# Hamburger Menu

This is a small css project to help keep my css skills working as my main focus is backend web development.

I created a hambuger toggle that turns into an x and brings down a drop down navigation menu when activated. I also created a hover effect of the hambuger toggle in which the lines change to different lengths when hovered over.
